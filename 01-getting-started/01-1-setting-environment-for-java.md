## Setting Environment for Java

Download [Java](https://java.com/en/download/)

For windows users: Once the installation is complete, put the path of Java in the environment variables. The path should look something like this C:\Program Files\java\jdk\bin

For linux and mac users: Java comes pre-installed.

You can check if the installation was correct by running the command :

`java` and `javac`

in your shell.

#### IDE

You can use any text editor to write Java programs, compile and run them through command line. 

However, using an IDE (Integrated development environment) provides a sophisticated interface for writing and debugging.

+ [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
+ [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

These are the famous ones.
