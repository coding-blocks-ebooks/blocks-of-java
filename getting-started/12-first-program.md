## First Program

Lets start by a simple program that prints Hello World on the console.

`public class Test {`

`public static void main(String[] args){`

`System.out.println("Hello World");`

`    }`

`}`

Lets see what is going on here.

* Firstly, we declare a class Test.
* The compiler starts reading our program from the main\(\) function. Therefore, anything meaningful has to be inside this main\(\) function.
* We write `System.out.println("Hello World");` to print Hello World on the console.
